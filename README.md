# Microservice Monorepo Playground

This repository serves as a playground for testing out a microservice monorepo in different programming languages and understanding Bazel better.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to explore the capabilities of a monorepo structure for microservices, and to gain a deeper understanding of how Bazel can be used to manage such a project.

## Languages

This project aims to test the monorepo structure across different programming languages. The languages currently being explored are:

- Javascript/Typescript
- Python

## Bazel

Bazel is an open-source build and test tool similar to Make, Maven, and Gradle. It uses a human-readable, high-level build language. Bazel supports projects in multiple languages and builds outputs for multiple platforms.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Bazel
3. Run the build command
